# i2c-shield

 An I2C shield for Feather and ItsyBitsy boards.
 Provides two Qwiic/Stemma QT connectors, a male 4-pin header, and pull-up resistors (3.3K).
 Also provides  four test points (Keystone 5000 or compatible, e.g. https://www.adafruit.com/product/3824),
 for connecting oscilloscope probes - very handy when you need to debug I2C connection.

 Pull-up resistors can be disconnected by breaking the solder bridge next to
 them using a sharp knife or a similar tool.
